// searchsort.ts decides what order a page of search results comes back in

//
// There are two steps and they are deliberately separate. First a query is
// classified into one of three kinds by what it is made of; then that kind's
// remembered preference is read, and 'auto' is resolved into a real order. The
// backend is only ever handed a real order, so the rule for what suits a query
// lives here rather than being half in the ui and half in Go.

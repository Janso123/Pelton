// read by one that cannot do woff2. The three webviews Pelton runs in
// (WKWebView, WebView2, WebKitGTK) have all supported woff2 for years, so every
// woff file here is weight nobody downloads.
//
// It is worth removing rather than ignoring: the Han face alone is 1.1 MB a
// weight, and shipping the dead copy of it costs more than the whole Arabic
// face does. Dropping them leaves the css pointing at a url that is not there,
// which is harmless because nothing ever requests it.
